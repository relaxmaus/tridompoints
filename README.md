# Tridominos Scorekeeper

## Overview

Tridominos Scorekeeper is a Flutter app designed to track the scores of any number of players in the games Triominos and Super Tridom. The app automatically applies game-specific rules, including bonus and penalty points for various actions. It recognizes the different phases of the game, such as the opening, main rounds, and the end of a round. Throughout the game, players can see not only their own scores but also the number of game pieces remaining.
